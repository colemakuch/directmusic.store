    <p>This site is a DIY algorithm-free and metric-free resource allowing fans to purchase music from artists directly, with no fees or cuts taken by payment processing or streaming platforms.<br>It also provides artists a stable web presence and link to host their music and payment options.<br>It was inspired by Cindy Lee's choice to only stream their album Diamond Jubilee on youtube, and host the music for download and purchase on <a href="https://www.geocities.ws/ccqsk/">this site</a>.<br><b>This site is built on trust and good faith. We basically just host links, and trust that arists and fans play nicely.<br>Please try to resolve issues independently, but concerns can be directed <a href="general-contact.html">here</a>.</b></p>
